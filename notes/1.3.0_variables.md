# Variables:

### Method 1
- Variables are defined in Terraform as follows: 
```text
variable "prefix" {
default = "tfnitin"
}
```
- and we can then reference variable later as follows: 

```text
name     = "${var.prefix}-resources"
```


- This is equivalent to tfnitin-resources

### Method 2
- we can also create variables.tf file to keep all variables separate and reference them in main.tf

- should be within same folder. 
```text

variable "prefix" { default = "tfnitin" }
variable "name" { default = "resources" }
variable "location" { default = "East US 2" }
```


- we can refernce variable directly too without ${}

```text
location = var.location
```

- Either ways are recommended.
